# Extendible-Hasing-Demo
Simulation of extendible hashing involving insertion of keys, splitting of buckets and the re-distribution of a splitting bucket's keys post-split.
Contents of buckets and their respective local depths (as well as the common global depth) updated whenever needed, and displayed through the GUI following each insertion of a key.
